# What works:
- macOS 11 Big Sur.
- Internal audio from speakers.
- Power Management.
- USB 3.0
- USB 2.0
- iServices (iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime), you need to generate your own SMBIOS config. See [OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/ivy-bridge.html#platforminfo)
- Clean and stable installation.

# How to use

Download the latest release, then extract the file and open the EFI folder.
If you want to learn more about it please read the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide).

Inside EFI > OC look at the config.plist file. Use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree.git) to open and edit the file. 

Generate the SMBIOS with [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). 

It is highly recommended to check the [PlatformInfo section](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/ivy-bridge.html#platforminfo) of the guide to know what you are doing. A Dell Optiplex 7010 has an Ivy Bridge processor, 
which means the SMBIOS required is iMac 14,4 for Big Sur or later. 

In ProperTree, go to PlatformInfo > Generic and complete the required fields with the result provided by GenSMBIOS.

- The Type part gets copied to Generic -> SystemProductName.
- The Serial part gets copied to Generic -> SystemSerialNumber.
- The Board Serial part gets copied to Generic -> MLB.
- The SmUUID part gets copied to Generic -> SystemUUID.

Save the config.plist and attempt to boot.

# Known Issues:
## Sleep 
When the computer is in sleep 2 things can happen:

- The Mac wakes up randomly with no response (Kernel Panic). 
- When user wakes the Mac up, at some point it doesn't respond (Kernel Panic).

Possible causes:
- Using an external SSD plugged in a USB 3.0 port.
- Power Management not working properly with S3 state.
- Some weird quirk with USB port mapping.

Workaround:
- Disable sleep in System Properties > Energy Saver.
    - Set Turn off display after Never.
    - Check Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off.
    - Uncheck the remaining options.




## Audio
Audio works almost perfectly except for 2 things:

- When using the headphone jack audio, there is a weird static noise (Possibly related to PM or chosen layout).
- After Mac wakes up from sleep, internal audio speakers no longer work. (Related to sleep issue)




## USB Ports During Mac OS First Installation 
- During the installation USB ports were not working, except for the one in use for the SSD. 

- Solved by connecting the mouse and keyboard to a USB Hub.
- Issue gets fixed after installation.

Note: Issue should be fixed now with the USB mapping, but hasn't been fully tested.
